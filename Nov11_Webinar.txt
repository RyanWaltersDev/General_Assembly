These are the notes from the free Webinar that I am attending on Nov 11 2020

>>>LEARNING OBJECTIVES
History of Python 
Benefits of Python workflow in data
Demonstrate Python fundamentals
Create a custom learning plan to build data science skills

>>>WHAT IS PYTHON?
Created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991
Emphasis on productivity and readability

>>>WHY IS PYTHON READABLE
Interpreted language -- step by step execution
Behaves the same on any machine or cloud, but this is a trade off for performance. 
Object Oriented language -- Code with objects that contain data and functions to manipulate it in predefined ways.

>>>WHY PYTHON?
Free, flexible, open source
Extensible with easy to install libraries
Great Documentaion with a large community. Most problems you have, somebody else has had the same problem.
Stack Overflow is a very large part of the Python Community
Scripts can be run many times

>>>WHO USES PYTHON? (Some examples)
Industry & Academia: AstroPy, BioPython
Web Development: YouTube, DropBox
Game Development: Civ IV
Standalone Apps: BitTorrent

>>>PROGRAMMING FUNDAMNETALS FRAMEWORK
Syntax -- The "grammar" of a coding langauge.
Variables -- How computers store information
Control Structures -- Sets the hierarchy/priorities of programming logic
Data Structures -- How computers organize data

>>>SYNTAX
Set of rules that define the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in that language.
Programming languages have code blocks and statements, like pragraphs and sentences

>>>VARIABLES
Symbolic names that store a specific piece of information
